ism:disseminationControls=\"DL_ONLY\">Executive Summary: From 1754 to 1763 Europe and the Americas were caught up in a \
 conflict between England, under King George II, and France, under King Louis XV. In Europe this period was known as \
 the Seven Years' War; in North America it came to be called the French and Indian War. It was a conflict over trade \
 and land. \

 <test:grandchildElement ism:classification=\"U\" \
 ism:ownerProducer=\"USA\" \
ism:disseminationControls=\"DL_ONLY\">Paragraph: The English sent Crown forces from England to fortify the \
 colonies and fight the French and Indian invaders, but it was also necessary to recruit soldiers from the \
 colonial population. The English army found that fighting an enemy in the near-wilderness of North America was \
 too much for their massed regiments. The dense forests and mountainous terrain required fighting men who knew \
 the habits of the enemy and could serve effectively as scouts and skirmishers.</test:grandchildElement> \
 <test:grandchildElement ism:classification=\"U\" ism:ownerProducer=\"USA\" ism:cuiBasic=\"CMPRS\">Paragraph: Men from local communities and nearby states were recruited to \
join ranger \
 companies in the Hudson Valley campaign. The New Hampshireman Robert Rogers formed the most notable of these \
 ranger companies.</test:grandchildElement> \

 <test:childElement ism:classification=\"U\" \
 ism:ownerProducer=\"USA\" \
ism:cuiBasic=\"JURY\" \
 ism:disseminationControls=\"DL_ONLY\">Paragraph: Rogers grew up in southern New Hampshire, in an area which had known \
 years of murderous Indian raids. He had the knowledge and the spirit to make a good ranger commander, and both he and \
 his brother James joined the war in the King's service as rangers. Soon his own company, Rogers' Rangers, was in \
 service in the upper Hudson River area where they became known for their successful but unorthodox \
 tactics.</test:childElement> \

 <test:childElement ism:classification=\"U\" ism:ownerProducer=\"USA\" ism:cuiBasic=\"JURY\">Paragraph: The Rangers wore distinctive green outfits and practiced tactics called \
\"Rogers' \
 Rules of Ranging,\" which the British considered unconventional. Rogers hired men solely on merit and shocked regular \
 commanders with his use of Indians and freed slaves.</test:childElement> \

 <test:grandchildElement ism:classification=\"U\" ism:ownerProducer=\"USA\" ism:cuiBasic=\"JURY\">All Rangers are to be subject to the rules and articles of war; to appear at \
roll- call \
every evening, on their own parade, equipped, each with a Firelock, sixty rounds of powder and ball, and a \
 hatchet, at which time an officer from each company is to inspect the same, to see they are in order, so as \
 to be ready on any emergency to march at a minute's warning; and before they are dismissed, the necessary \
 guards are to be draughted, and scouts for the next day appointed</test:grandchildElement> \
 <test:grandchildElement ism:classification=\"U\" ism:ownerProducer=\"USA\" ism:cuiBasic=\"JURY\">Whenever you are ordered out to the enemies forts or frontiers for \
discoveries, if your \
 number be small, march in a single file, keeping at such a distance from each other as to prevent one shot \
 from killing two men, sending one man, or more, forward, and the like on each side, at the distance of twenty \
 yards from the main body, if the ground you march over will admit of it, to give the signal to the officer of \
 the approach of an enemy, and of their number, &amp;c.</test:grandchildElement> \
